# Group Project 1: Fun Finder

## Description

For this project, we will be creating a web application that will allow users to find activities, such as restaurants and movies, and obtain weather information about a given location. The application will take in a location given by the user, and render a list of these activities for the user to choose from. We will also implement a weather API that will provide users the forecast at the time the location is given.

## User Story

```
As a user planning a day out
I want access to a location's restaurants, movies in theatres, and weather
so that I can plan the day accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to find activities around a certain location
WHEN I enter a location and click the search bar
THEN I am given a list of restaurants, movies, and the weather in the area
WHEN I click on one of the recommended cities
THEN I am presented with data of that city
```
