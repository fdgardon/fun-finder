# Group Project 1: Fun Finder

## Description
For this project, we will be creating a web application that will allow users to find activities to do within radius of a given location, inlcuding dining, watching movies, shopping, and other outdoor activities. The application will take in a location given by the user, and return a list of restaurants, movies in theaters, local attractions, and shopping centers. We will also implement a weather API that will provide users the forecast at the time the location is given.

## User Story
```
As a user planning a trip
I want access to a wide variety of information on my destination
so that I can plan the trip accordingly
```
## Acceptance Criteria
